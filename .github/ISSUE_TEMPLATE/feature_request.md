#Title

## Background
Describe the current problem or limitation.  
**Example:**  
> Our logging system currently writes logs directly to text files with no rotation or formatting. This makes it difficult to search logs, integrate with monitoring tools, or analyze errors.

## Objective
State the high-level goal of the change.  
**Example:**  
> Introduce a structured logging framework (e.g., Serilog, Winston, or Log4j) to provide consistent, queryable logs that can be integrated with external monitoring systems.

## Requirements
List the detailed tasks or changes needed.  
**Examples:**
- **System Design**
  - Replace plain text logging with structured JSON logs
  - Support configurable log levels (Debug, Info, Error)
- **Integration**
  - Send logs to a central service (e.g., ELK, Datadog, CloudWatch)
- **Code Changes**
  - Refactor existing logging calls to use the new framework
  - Add middleware to automatically log HTTP requests and responses
- **Testing**
  - Verify logs are correctly formatted
  - Ensure sensitive data (like passwords) is never logged

## Benefits
Explain why this work matters.  
**Example:**  
- Developers can filter logs more effectively during debugging  
- Ops teams can monitor application health with alerts  
- Easier compliance with auditing requirements  

## Acceptance Criteria
Checklist of what must be true for the issue to be considered complete.  
**Examples:**
- [ ] All log output uses the new structured logging framework  
- [ ] Configurable log levels are respected in dev, staging, and prod  
- [ ] Logs integrate successfully with monitoring system  
- [ ] Unit tests and integration tests verify critical functionality  
- [ ] Documentation updated with instructions on configuring log levels  

## Additional Notes
Include any context, risks, or phased rollout ideas.  
**Example:**  
> Begin rollout by updating logging in authentication and payment services before applying changes to the entire application.
