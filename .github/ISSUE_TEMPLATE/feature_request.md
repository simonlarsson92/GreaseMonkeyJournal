#Title

## Background
Currently, our application may be tightly coupling components and services, making the codebase difficult to test and maintain. Implementing proper dependency injection with interfaces will improve the architecture, testability, and maintainability of the codebase.

## Objective
Refactor the current service implementation to use a proper dependency injection (DI) pattern with interfaces, enhancing testability and maintainability.

## Requirements
- **Service Interfaces**
  - Create interfaces for all existing services
  - Each interface defines the contract that implementing classes must fulfill
  - Place interfaces in an appropriate folder structure (e.g., `/Interfaces` or alongside implementations)

- **Dependency Injection Container**
  - Implement a DI container (built-in or third-party as appropriate for the tech stack)
  - Configure service registration with correct lifetime scopes (`singleton`, `transient`, `scoped`)
  - Use constructor injection pattern for dependencies

- **Service Implementation**
  - Refactor existing services to implement their respective interfaces
  - Remove direct instantiation of dependencies in favor of injected dependencies
  - Ensure services respect the **Dependency Inversion Principle**

- **Testing**
  - Create unit tests for each service using mock implementations of dependencies
  - Add integration tests to verify DI configuration
  - Ensure test coverage for critical service functionality

## Benefits
- Improved testability (via mockable dependencies)
- Clearer separation of concerns
- More maintainable codebase with reduced coupling
- Better adherence to **SOLID** principles

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All services have corresponding interfaces  
- [ ] Dependency injection container is properly configured  
- [ ] Unit tests demonstrate services can be tested in isolation  
- [ ] Integration tests verify proper resolution of dependencies  
- [ ] No direct instantiation of services (except in DI configuration)  
- [ ] Documentation for the DI approach is added to the project  

## Additional Notes
Consider reviewing the current architecture to identify the most critical services first. This may be an **incremental process** rather than a single large refactoring.
